Run the downloaded installer file by double clicking on it.
The Muzicast installer should start.

Click :guilabel:`Next` to start the installation.

Select where you want to install Muzicast.

Muzicast will now install various files. Wait
until that is finished. Once done, the installer
will prompt you to install a few other programs required
by Muzicast. You can simply keep clicking :guilabel:`Next` on
each page and things will install fine.

The following programs are installed:

* Python
* setuptools
* Python Imaging Library
* PyYAML

After this a black window will display for a few seconds while the installation
finishes the final steps. Once it says 'Finished', you can click
:guilabel:`Finish`. Muzicast is now installed!

Start Muzicast
--------------

The installer will have created a Start Menu entry. Just click
on Muzicast. A terminal window should launch. Muzicast is now running.

.. important::

   Do not close the DOS window that is launched. It is Muzicast running and
   will stop running if the window is closed.

You can finish the installation by following the
:doc:`/quickstart` guide.
