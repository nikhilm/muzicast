Accessing the web interface
===========================

If you are running ProjectName on your own computer, you may view the
interface by visiting http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.

If a friend or co-worker is running ProjectName on another computer in your
network, you should  ask them for a number called their *IP Address* and
then enter that into your browser like http://{IP Address}:4000.

When you visit the website hosting ProjectName, this is the interface you will
see by default:

.. todo:: Put screenshot of home with huge number for various elements

#. Is the main panel. All content specific to the page, like albums of an Artist, Top Tracks for the day are shown in this area.

#. Is the search box. You can enter some text into the search box and press :kbd:`Enter` to search artists, albums and tracks.

#. These tabs allow you to navigate the web interface.

#. The left pane is filled with information when you are signed in as a registered user. This will show any playlist you are currently editing and other details.
