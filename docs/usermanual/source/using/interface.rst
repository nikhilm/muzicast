Accessing the web interface
===========================

If you are running Muzicast on your own computer, you may view the
interface by visiting http://127.0.0.1:7664 in your web browser.

If a friend or co-worker is running Muzicast on another computer in your
network, you should  ask them for a number called their *IP Address* and
then enter that into your browser like http://{IP Address}:7664.

When you visit the website hosting Muzicast, this is the interface you will
see by default:
