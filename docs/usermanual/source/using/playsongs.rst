Playing Tracks
==============

.. todo:: Do we offer a flash player?!

ProjectName provides a very convenient, in-browser player to
listen to tracks. But often you want to play songs in your dedicated
music player like `iTunes <http://www.apple.com/itunes/>`_, `Amarok
<http://amarok.kde.org>`_ or `VLC <http://videolan.org>`_. In fact
ProjectName is built to play the music in these players, and once you
start creating :doc:`/using/playlists`, that is exactly what you will do.

The track's short profile and information page always show the URL over
which the track can be streamed live. Simply copy and paste this link
into your music player. For example in VLC you would go to
:menuselection:`&Media --> Open &Network Stream` and paste the link for
the track in the dialog that appears. Press :guilabel:`&Play` to play the
track.

Track information
-----------------

ProjectName keeps detailed statistics about tracks and their associated
attributes like artist, album, play count and rating, together called
**meta-data**. 

On a track page you can find the total play count, and you can view the rating
or give your own rating.

.. note:: You must be signed in to add ratings.
