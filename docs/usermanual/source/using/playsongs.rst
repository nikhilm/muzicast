Playing Tracks
==============

Muzicast provides a very convenient, in-browser player to
listen to tracks. But often you want to play songs in your dedicated
music player like `iTunes <http://www.apple.com/itunes/>`_, `Amarok
<http://amarok.kde.org>`_ or `VLC <http://videolan.org>`_. In fact
Muzicast is built to play the music in these players, and once you
start creating :doc:`/using/playlists`, that is exactly what you will do.

The track's short profile and information page always show the URL over
which the track can be streamed live. Simply copy and paste this link
into your music player. For example in VLC you would go to
:menuselection:`&Media --> Open &Network Stream` and paste the link for
the track in the dialog that appears. Press :guilabel:`&Play` to play the
track.

Track information
-----------------

Muzicast keeps detailed statistics about tracks and their associated
attributes like artist, album, play count and rating, together called
**meta-data**. 

On a track page you can find the total play count, and you can view the rating
or give your own rating.

.. note:: You must be signed in to add ratings.

To get detailed statistics click the statistics.

Library information
-------------------

Muzicast collects statistics for albums and artists as well, and you can
view them on the album or artist page.
In addition Muzicast will try to fetch album covers from `Amazon
<http://www.amazon.com>`_ when it can find them.

Playlists
---------

You can create a playlist by adding songs from the web interface. Simply press
the :guilabel:`+` icon next to a track, album or artist. An unregistered user
only has one playlist, which is **not saved**. Once you close the web interface
or the browser, the playlist is lost.

Registered users may save and share playlists. For complete playlist
documentation read the :doc:`Playlists section </using/playlists>`.
