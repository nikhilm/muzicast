Playing Tracks
==============

Muzicast provides a very convenient, in-browser player to
listen to tracks. Simply click on a track and the track page
will have a player to listen to the track.

.. note::

    Adobe Flash player should be installed to listen to the music in the
    browser.

But often you want to play songs in your dedicated
music player like `iTunes <http://www.apple.com/itunes/>`_, `Amarok
<http://amarok.kde.org>`_ or `VLC <http://videolan.org>`_. In fact
Muzicast is built to play the music in these players, and once you
start creating :doc:`/using/playlists`, that is exactly what you will do.

The track's short profile and information page always show the URL over
which the track can be streamed live. Simply copy and paste this link
into your music player. For example in VLC you would go to
:menuselection:`&Media --> Open &Network Stream` and paste the link for
the track in the dialog that appears. Press :guilabel:`&Play` to play the
track.

Track information
-----------------

Muzicast keeps detailed statistics about tracks and their associated
attributes like artist, album, play count, together called
**meta-data**. 

On a track page you can find the total play count and when it was last played.

Library information
-------------------

Muzicast collects statistics for albums and artists as well and uses them to
suggest top albums and artists.

In addition Muzicast will try to fetch album covers from `Last.fm <http://last.fm>`_ when it can find them.

Playlists
---------

You can create a playlist by adding songs from the web interface. Simply press
the :guilabel:`+` icon next to a track, album or artist. An unregistered user
only has one playlist, which is **not saved**. Once you close the web interface
or the browser, the playlist is lost.

Registered users may save and share playlists. For complete playlist
documentation read the :doc:`Playlists section </using/playlists>`.
