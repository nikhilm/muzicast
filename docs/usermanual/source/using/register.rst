User Accounts
=============

A user account allows frequent users of a Muzicast server
to create and share playlists, save them and modify them later.

.. todo:: do we allow uploads!?

Register
--------

Registration is simple, simply click the :guilabel:`Register` button, fill in
the fields in the registration form, and click :guilabel:`Register`. Once you
are registered you can login in to the server.

Uploading files
---------------

.. todo:: do we really support this? If we do, we've to consider file size,
create an admin interface for setting max upload size, who is allowed etc.

Deleting your account
---------------------

If you ever want to delete your account, visit your profile by click on your username
in the web interface. The :guilabel:`Delete` button will delete your account.
You have to re-enter your password and confirm the step to delete your account.
Accounts are deleted within a few minutes and **no personal data is retained**.

.. note:: Deleting your account will delete all playlists you have created. But
it does not affect the ratings you've given to tracks.
