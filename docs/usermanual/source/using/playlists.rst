Playlists
=========

Playlists are the most important feature of ProjectName.
You can:

* Create a custom playlist by manually inserting tracks, albums and artists, queueing them up in your music player, and listening to the
  tracks.
* Randomize playlist orders.
* Set playlists to loop or play randomly [TODO: REALLY?]
* Use public playlists and create and modify copies of them.
* Subscribe to **dynamic** playlists which keep streaming tracks of a certain
  genre. This is a great way to discover new music. [TODO: again are we doing
  this?]

In addition, if you are a :doc:`registered user </using/register>` you may:

* Create **multiple** playlists.
* **Save** playlists permanently and modify them.
* **Share** playlists or keep them private.

Creating Playlists
------------------

.. todo:: Add screenshot of "Add to Playlist button"

Any musical item -- track, album and artist -- has a "Add to Playlist" button
next to it. This makes it very easy to create playlists. If you do not have any
existing playlists, or you are not :ref:`editing a playlist
<editing_playlists>` then a new one is automatically created the
first time you add an item. Any additional items you select get added to this
:term:`active playlist`.

The :term:`active playlist` is shown to the side of the web interface once you create it.
If there are a lot of tracks, only the first few entries will be shown, but you
can click on the playlist any time to view the full list. The link next to the
playlist can be inserted into your music player any time to start playing added
tracks.

.. _playlist_options:

Playlist options
----------------

The playlist has a few options other than the list of tracks.

Playlist name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new playlist is by default named as "Playlist" followed by the date and time
when the first track was added. To rename the :term:`active playlist` you can click
on the name, change it and press :guilabel:`save`. To rename other playlists, you can go to the
:ref:`playlist manager <editing_playlists>` and rename them by clicking on the
name.

.. todo:: Add icon pictures

Shuffle
^^^^^^^
You can make the tracks in the playlist play randomly by toggling the Shuffle
icon next to the playlist name or in the :ref:`playlist manager
<editing_playlists>`.

Loop
^^^^
You can make the playlist repeat itself once all the tracks are played by
toggling the Loop icon next to the playlist name or in the :ref:`playlist
manager <editing_playlists>`.

Share with everybody
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can make the playlist publicly available by checking the :guilabel:`Share`
icon next to the playlist name in the :ref:`playlist manager
<editing_playlists>`.

.. note:: This feature is only available for :doc:`registered users </using/register>` who are logged in.

.. _editing_playlists:

Editing Playlists
-----------------
Playlists created by registered users are permanently saved. Those created by
guests are deleted a few hours after the session is over (unless it is being
played). At any point during this time you may edit various :ref:`playlist options <playlist_options>`.

.. todo:: Insert playlist manager screenshot

You can view all your playlists in the :term:`Playlist Manager` which can be accessed
by clicking on the :guilabel:`Playlists` tab once you are logged in.

You can perform the various actions :ref:`mentioned above <playlist_options>`.
In addition you can delete and edit playlists.

Delete a playlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete a playlist, click the :guilabel:`Delete` button corresponding to the
playlist and confirm your choice.

.. warning:: 

    Playlists once deleted are not recoverable. This operation
    cannot be undone. Be sure of your decision before you press the
    :guilabel:`Delete` button.

Editing a playlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adding tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To set a playlist as the :term:`active playlist` so that you can add tracks to it,
click the :guilabel:`Edit` button next to the playlist name. You should now see
the playlist shown at the side. You can now go to any track, albumm or artist
and click :guilabel:`Add` to add it to this playlist.

Setting the active playlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to switch to a new playlist to add some other tracks, you can
simply select another playlist from the drop down menu near the side, and
choose another existing playlist or a new playlist as the :term:`active playlist`.

Deleting or re-ordering tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete tracks, click on the playlist name. You will see a page with all the
tracks belonging to the playlist. You can now remove them as you wish, or
re-arrange them to change the play order.

.. warning::
    Both deleting and re-ordering operations cannot be undone. Be careful.
