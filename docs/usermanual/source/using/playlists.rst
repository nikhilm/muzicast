Playlists
=========

Playlists are the most important feature of Muzicast.
You can create a custom playlist by manually inserting tracks, albums and artists, queueing them up in your music player, and listening to the tracks.

In addition, if you are a :doc:`registered user </using/register>` you may:

* Create **multiple** playlists.
* **Save** playlists permanently and modify them.

Creating Playlists
------------------

Any musical item -- track, album and artist -- has a "Add to Playlist" button
next to it. This makes it very easy to create playlists. If you do not have any
existing playlists, or you are not :ref:`editing a playlist
<editing_playlists>` then a new one is automatically created the
first time you add an item. Any additional items you select get added to this
:term:`active playlist`.

The :term:`active playlist` is shown to the side of the web interface once you create it.
You can click :guilabel:`Download` at any time to download the playlist and
play the tracks in a music player.

All the sections below assume that you are **logged in**.

Save a playlist
---------------

To save the active playlist, give it a name and click save. The playlist is
then saved, but the active playlist is cleared.

Editing Playlists
-----------------
Playlists created by registered users are permanently saved. Those created by
guests are deleted when they close the browser. At any point during this time you may edit them. Click on :guilabel:`Playlist Manager` in the right playlist pane to view your saved playlists.

Editing a playlist

Adding tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To set a playlist as the :term:`active playlist` so that you can add tracks to it,
click the :guilabel:`Edit` button next to the playlist name. You should now see
the playlist shown at the side. You can now go to any track, albumm or artist
and click :guilabel:`Add` to add it to this playlist.

Setting the active playlist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to switch to a new playlist to add some other tracks, you can
simply select another playlist from the drop down menu near the side, and
choose another existing playlist or a new playlist as the :term:`active playlist`.

Deleting tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete tracks, set the playlist as the active playlist and then remove tracks.
