Administration
==============

The administration interface is accessible at any time through the link in the
footer of any page. You will be asked to enter the administrator password
before you can continue. As Muzicast is supposed to be easy to use, there isn't
much to administer. But to safeguard your music collection
Muzicast offers very granular control over what music is shared.

The folder selection area allows you to select which directories are to be
scanned for music.

Checking a folder will also cause all sub-folders to be also scanned for music.
If you want only certain sub-folders to be scanned, you should expand the tree
and select only those folders.

A square check indicates that **some** folders below that folder are currently
shared.

Click :guilabel:`Save` once all changes are done to add/remove folders and the
music.

Muzicast watches all shared folders for changes, so any time you make some
changes to the music in your shared folders, Muzicast will automatically pick
it up, you **DO NOT** need to check the folders again.
