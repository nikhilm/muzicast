Is Muzicast free?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, Muzicast is free and open source software under the MIT License. You are
welcome to use, redistribute and modify it.

I would like to see a new feature in Muzicast.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Send us an email requesting the feature at `nsm.nikhil@gmail.com
<mailto:nsm.nikhil@gmail.com>`_ and we might consider adding it. Of course,
since Muzicast is open source you can just `get the code
<http://github.com/nikhilm/muzicast>`_ and add it yourself if you can program
in Python.

Does Muzicast have Last.fm support?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though Muzicast fetches covers from `Last.fm <http://last.fm>`_, it does not
support scrobbling tracks.  Any modern music
player has last.fm integration, so it can submit your
information based on your settings. We do not want to
duplicate this effort.
